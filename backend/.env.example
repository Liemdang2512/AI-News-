# Backend network binding configuration
# Default host (0.0.0.0) keeps the service accessible from other machines /
# containers, matching the original behaviour before BACKEND_HOST was added.
# For desktop/Electron builds that only need local access, you can override to:
#   BACKEND_HOST=127.0.0.1
BACKEND_HOST=0.0.0.0
BACKEND_PORT=8000
